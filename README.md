# AIM-3D
Our very first Unity 3D Group Project. For this project we received an assignment to produce a 3D game with different input than a mouse and keyboard in the short time of 4 weeks. We did not have very much knowledge about Unity C# programming yet, so the project is not really 'loosely coupled' as you would say. But I am leaving it as it as, so you can see the progress that we have made with programming.
